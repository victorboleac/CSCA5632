##Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning Final Project
###This project involves analyzing a dataset that contains characteristics of patients diagnosed with cancer. The primary goal is to classify the cancers into benign or malignant categories. We plan to use an unsupervised learning approach, specifically KMeans clustering, to perform this classification. Additionally, we will compare the effectiveness of this unsupervised method against conventional supervised learning techniques.
